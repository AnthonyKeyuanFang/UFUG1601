## Week 3 Lab: Control Flow in Python - If-Else, While Loop

### Objective

The objective of this lab is to understand and practice control flow in Python using If-Else statements and While loops. Students will be asked to write simple programs that make decisions based on conditions and repeat certain tasks while a condition is met.

### Tasks

1. **Task 1: If-Else Statements (20 minutes)** - In this task, students should write a program that makes decisions based on user input. For example:

    * Write a program that asks the user for their age.
    * If the age is 18 or above, print "You are an adult".
    * If the age is less than 18, print "You are a minor".

    Provide the following example to guide the students:

    ```python
    age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
    if age >= 18:
        print("You are an adult")
    else:
        print("You are a minor")
    ```

2. **Task 2: While Loop (20 minutes)** - Students should write a program that uses a while loop to repeat a task. For example:

    * Write a program that counts down from 10 to 0.
    * Use a while loop to print the current number and then decrement the number.
    * When the loop ends, print "Blast off!".

    Provide the following example to guide the students:

    ```python
    count = 10
    while count >= 0:
        print(count)
        count -= 1
    print("Blast off!")
    ```

### Homework Assignment

As a homework assignment, students should be asked to write a program that uses both if-else statements and while loops. For example, they could create a guessing game where the user has to guess a random number. The game should give hints (like "too high" or "too low") and keep track of how many guesses it takes.

[**Tips** :bulb:] Thinking about how to experiment with different conditions and loop structures. Also, remind them that the tasks should be seen as a starting point and that they should try to come up with their own programs to further practice the concepts.
