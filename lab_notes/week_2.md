## Week 2 Lab: Variables, Data Types, and Assignments

### Objective

The main objective of this lab is to familiarize students with the basic Python concepts of variables, data types, and assignments. Students will perform various tasks to ensure they can correctly declare variables, understand different data types, and use assignment operators.

### Tasks

1. **Task 1: Variable Assignments (15 minutes)** - In this task, students should declare variables to store different types of information. For instance: 

    * Declare a variable `name` to store your name.
    * Declare a variable `age` to store your age.
    * Declare a variable `is_student` to indicate whether you are a student or not.

    Provide the following example to guide the students:

    ```python
    name = "John Doe"
    age = 20
    is_student = True
    ```

2. **Task 2: Data Types (15 minutes)** - The students should determine the data type of different variables. For instance:

    * Declare a variable `data` and assign it the value "Hello, World!".
    * Use the `type()` function to print the type of the variable `data`.Provide the following example to guide the students:

    Provide the following example to guide the students:

    ```python
    data = "Hello, World!"
    print(type(data))  # <class 'str'>
    ```

3. **Task 3: Assignment Operators (15 minutes)** - The students should practice using different assignment operators. For instance:

    * Declare a variable `x` and assign it the value 10.
    * Use the `+=` operator to add 5 to `x`.
    * Use the `*=` operator to multiply `x` by 2.

    Provide the following example to guide the students:
    ```python
    x = 10
    x += 5  # Equivalent to x = x + 5
    x *= 2  # Equivalent to x = x * 2
    print(x)  # 30
    ```

### Homework Assignment

As a homework assignment, students should be asked to create a simple program that gets user input (using the `input()` function), performs some operations on the input, and prints the result. For example, they could create a simple calculator that gets two numbers from the user and performs various operations (like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).

[**Tips** :bulb:] Thinking about how to ask questions and help each other out. The lab should be a safe environment for them to make mistakes and learn from them.
